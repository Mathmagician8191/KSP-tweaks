Fixes a few balance problems with KSP and USI life support

Is organised into files by adjustment so you can pick and choose
(although some cost tweaks are incorporated into other changes)

Features:

Fixed ways to get free money:
* Mining on kerbin and recovering the ore (mining on kerbin is disabled)
* Converting ore to monoprop (ore price has been increased)
* Converting fertilizer and mulch to supplies (tweaked costs of fertilizer and supplies)

Fixed "get out and push"
* jetpack fuel no longer replenishes when you return to a craft (you must get an engineer to place it on the craft and transfer fuel)
* fuel is now monoprop (so you have capacity to transfer it)
* reduced fuel and thrust (the jetpack is too OP compared to real life)
* the jetpack now requires space exploration tech
* kerbals by default have no inventory items
* command pods by default have no monoprop

Fixed free science
* labs now no longer research, they are just an experiment that requires a scientist

Other science changes
* made the barometer not work without an atmosphere
* made the thermometer, barometer and seismometer have 100% transmission efficiency

Life support
* balanced the window types
* changed the grace periods to be more realistic

Reentry
* heat tolerance of crewed parts now only 800K

Miscellaneous changes
* tweaked costs of some parts
* increased the number of active contracts
* gave the cupola an inventory since it is the only crewed part missing one
* made Mk3 passenger module's "no checked luggage" claim accurate (removed the inventory)
* made the nuclear engine heat up more so radiators are more of a requirement
